Main Character must be movable with Courser keys:
-A person / Cal Poly Student moves up, down, left, right across the screen

Least 3 different kind of entities where one kind is moving using a "new" pathing algorithm:
-A's (stationary object - similar to fish, only left-side)
-F's (hailing down, like a stream in the center of the world, in the middle)
-Person (movable character)
-Grade Book (stationary spot - similar to Atlantis, on the right-side, one on top, one on bottom )
-Sickness (temperature icon, pathing strategy to find the person DIY)

ON MOUSE CLICK :
 - World Changing Event: Visualization
    - poof of warning signs of 8 blocks around where the mouse clicked
    - that spot now can't be entered (treated as an obstacle)

 - World Changing Event: Effect
    -F's change to a different color and fall faster in the column closest to where the user clicked

 - World Changing Event: New Entity
    - Creates sickness that is chasing you

How to trigger the event:
 - by mouse click

What should happen when the event is triggered"
 - sickness appears

What the affected entities should do:
 - The affected entities should move faster and change color

What the new entity is and how it should behave:
 - The new entity is a sickness blob that chases the person around the screen

What each partner was responsible for completing:
 - Both worked equally on everything
 - Both created and added ideas
 - Both documented the code
